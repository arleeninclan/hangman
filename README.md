# Hangman 

## How it will be played:
<p> There are two versions to this game. They are one-player and two-player versions. A one-player game will be against the computer and two-player game will be with someone on a different computer. </p>
###One-Player Game:
<p> The computer will spit out a word that was randomly chosen from a huge set of words/phrases, substitute underscores for it, and the player will try and guess it. The game will keep going until player has guessed the word or there are no tries left.</p>
### Two-Player Game:
<p> In this version, the players will be allowed to play with each other through different computers. Player 1 will input the word and be substituted with underscores and Player 2 will guess letters, until game is lost/won. </p>

## How game can be won or lost:
<p> For every letter that the player will guess, it will be run through a method that will check if the letter is in the word given to guess. </p>
<p> If it is in the word, then the game will keep going. </p>
<p> If it is not in the word, it will add a body part to complete hanging man, leaving the player with one less try. The number of tries will be in sync with the body parts: for every body part added, decrease tries by one. Game will keep going until a full body is there (all tries are used). </p>

## How game will be set up:
<p> The letters in the word will get replaced with underscores, while the word is still stored somewhere else. There will be a place for the player to input a letter and a space for the body of the "hangman" to appear. </p>

## How errors will be accepted:
